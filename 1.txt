[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] Jill![STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Wha?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] Jill, are you here yet? The bar opens in a #few minutes.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Huh, what?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] Gil already cleaned the glasses, we're just #waiting on you.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I- I'm here.[STOPLIP:]
[SHOW:185,sprite_dana][XS:danaface,][XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] There you are. And right on time.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] G'eveni-... What?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] Something wrong?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Putting aside the fact that I don't have any #recollection how I even got here...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Why are you wearing cat ears, Boss?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] Wearing? I'm not wearing anything.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Wait, are they... moving? Don't tell #me...)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (ARE THEY REAL?!)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] W- why do you have cat ears, Boss?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:danaface,worry][XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] Because they are cute and cool.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] No, I meant: Why do YOU have cat ears?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:danaface,][XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] Because of the milk.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] What are you-[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Why is there milk in the bar dispenser?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Wait, is that real milk? Where did you even #get that?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] It was a gift from Iris. You remember Iris, #right?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Your friend that has a bar in Saint Alicia? #You mentioned her a few times.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] Yes, her. I was talking with her about how #cute her ears were and she asked me if I wanted a #pair too.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] And today, I arrive to a parcel containing #the milk and a note.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] 'Everyone that drinks this milk gets at #least three times cuter' it said.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] Can't argue with results.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (...Can't argue, indeed.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:danaface,worry][XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] Hey, no staring unless you give me something #to stare at too.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:danaface,][XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] Here, drink up. It's on the house.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Boss, do you expect me to just drink #something that might make me grow cat ears for no #reason? Are you sure it's safe?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:danaface,closedsmile][XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] Hey, be happy I told you what it does before #you drank it.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] If it'll put you at ease I can tell you that #its been thoroughly tested, so don't worry![STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Tested?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:danaface,][XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] I decided to at least share the fun.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Wait, what does that mean? Did you-[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] Anyway, leave it out. That way customers can #see it. But don't feel shy about drinking it #yourself. I'll be in my office.[XS:danhide,1][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Yeah, yeah...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (I've had many strange days lately, but #today feels different.)[XS:ph,-1][XS:juke,1][E:2][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Time to mix drinks and change lives.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Huh, strange. I don't see Gil anywhere. #Getting supplies maybe?)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Ah, haa...haa. So I was faster after all.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...Welcome to Valhalla, Sei. You sound like #you ran a marathon.[STOPLIP:]
[SHOW:185,sprite_seiwound][XS:seiface,sorry][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] I- haa... I did. Stella challenged me who'd #be here faster- haa... me, running or her, #driving.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] And you WON? In your condition? Wow...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Eh, I think you have it wrong. Haa- Stella #lives uptown, remember? And then there's also the- #haa... the traffic around this time.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Still, that's impressive... scary, almost.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Wait, does that mean you ran a whole #district here?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Something- haa... like that. Nothing I #wouldn't be able to- haa... run were I not so out #of shape.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] You? Out of shape? What do you call ME #then?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Jill, probably. Haa... But please don't make #such a big- haa... deal out of it. This would've #only been the warm-up back in the boot camps.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (And I maintain: Impressive and scary.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...Ok then, care for a celebratory drink?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Sounds great, but just water for n- ...wait, #is that milk on the counter?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Uh oh.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Yes... it's milk. Real milk at that. However #it... might have some side-effects.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Side-effects? Like causing flank pain? I #don't think you have to worry, my torso's pretty #tough. My instructor always told me-[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Not that kind of- No, it seems to make you #grow cat ears.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,sorry][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Cat ears? Like Stella?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Pretty much. I don't know the details, but I #saw Boss with cat ears today. And they seemed too #real to be a prank. But...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,happy][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] What? That sounds so cute. I wish I could've #seen her.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] You know, I always wondered what it's like to #have cat ears. They look so soft.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] I'll take one milk, please.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:seiface,][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Thank you.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:seiface,sorry][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Wh- what? Oh, sorry. I was just lost in #thought. This milk made some memories flood back #in.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Judging from your expression, I'm guessing #it wasn't the happy kind?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Yes and no. Some were happy, some were not. #But they're my memories. And all my memories are #welcome.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] ...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] It's mostly just stuff from when Stella and I #were kids. The usual adventures and fights.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,sad][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] There's...some darker moments as well.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Do you need a minute?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] ...no. It's alright.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] It's those memories that make us who we are #today. And thanks to this milk, I was able to #relive those memories.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] This is my first glass in quite a while. Back #then, we drank a lot of milk. Stella's parents #made sure of that. I almost feel like-[XS:seiface,pain][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] They do look fluffy. Similar to Fore's.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Hm? About what?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Her ears.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Really? It feels more like her whole #appearance is based on proudly presenting then.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Actually, it's the opposite. She's presenting #them to distract from them. Make them seem like #the most normal thing in the world.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] She hates to be seen as different from the #others.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] And if everybody acknowledges them from the #first moment, then she's just a girl.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I didn't think there were still people that #discriminate against Cat Boomers in Glitch #City...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] There are a few, but it's not her appearance #towards others she's afraid of.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,sad][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] I guess you could say it's also her parents' #fault in a way. She told me that she was always #presented as their 'cat boomer daughter'...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] She must've felt like it was her whole #identity.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] And that's why she started dressing so #flashy?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Yeah, it was a few years ago, but-[STOPLIP:]

[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Glad to see you finally made it.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] You. Cat ears. Why?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Oh right, these? They are because of the #milk. Wanna feel how soft they are? But be #careful, they're still sensitive.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] Jill. Help.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I can't tell you what I don't know.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] What I can tell you is that Boss got some #milk from a friend and it seems to make people #grow cat ears when they drink it.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] And Sei just drank it? You idiot. Who #knows what could've happened?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] I was wondering the same, so I decided to #test it. Mystery solved![STOPLIP:]
[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] You too, Jill! How could you've been so #reckless?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Boss drank it too, so we knew it wouldn't #kill or harm her at least.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:stelface,][XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] With how tough your boss is, I'd imagine #she could drink poison and be fine.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...Touché.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:stelface,concern][XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] Why would you do that? Why would you want #to grow a pair of cat ears?[STOPLIP:]

[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] ...cheer me up?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] You always seemed so unhappy about them.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] What was that?[STOPLIP:]

[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Eh?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] You would risk your well-being just to #make me feel better about myself?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Is that so strange?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] There are less dangerous ways to go about #it, at least![STOPLIP:]

[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] I already have cat ears, so there's not #much that could happen. And looking at that glass #made me thirsty for milk.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Maybe we should leave drinks out in the #open more often. Seems to be good advertising.)[STOPLIP:]

[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] Was there a reason you didn't give me a #milk? It seemed like you were really interested in #finding out what would happen.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (She noticed?!)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Well, I was, but it's a bit too dangerous. #We know it worked on Boss and Sei, but who knows #what might happen to a cat boomer?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Granted, the person that sent us the milk is #a cat boomer, but with the existence of this milk, #that might not even be true in the first place.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:stelface,baka][XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] ...[STOPLIP:]

[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] Everywhere I go I'm always treated #differently. It's hard to notice, but with time #you are able to read the faces of those people.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:stelface,][XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] And I get it. Cat Boomers are pretty rare, #so people want to ask questions.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] And there's good things about them too. They #are soft and they are fluffy.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] On good days they are, yes.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] And seeing them on you makes me realize #why people like to stare. They're hypnotizing![STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Seeing both of them almost makes me #jealous.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:stelface,][XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] But there's one more practical downside to #them.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] What's that?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] I can't wear hats. And you remember how #much I struggled to squeeze into your helmet.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Yeah, that makes sense. I can't remember ever #seeing you wear a hat for more than a few #minutes.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,happy][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Oh I have an idea! Let's cut holes in your #hats so your ears aren't squished.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:stelface,happy][XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] That's such a bad idea! Can you imagine #how much even one of them costs?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] More than my whole wardrobe, probably. But #that way you would at least get some use out of #them.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:stelface,][XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] I'll think about it, okay? But for now I #think we've taken up enough of Jill's time with #our cat chatter.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] You're probably right.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Oh, when I drank the milk, I remembered a #funny story from when we were still in school.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] I hope it's not the one I'm thinking of. #Is it the one where your festival stand got #trashed?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,sorry][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] How did you know?![STOPLIP:]
[XS:stelface,happy][XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] I guess I just know how you tick.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] Goodbye, Jill.[XS:stelhide,1][STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Hey, wait up. Bye, Jill.[XS:seihide,1][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Goodbye, you two.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Seems that milk made them really happy. #Good for them.)[XS:goodExp,1][XS:ph,33][E:33][STOPLIP:]

[XS:mix,0][RES:][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Here you go.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] Did you get cold feet halfway through?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Sorry, I just think that serving this milk #is a bad idea.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] Don't tell me you actually believe there's #such a thing as milk that makes you grow ears?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...Of course not. But what if there IS? This #is still Glitch City, the place where a hamster #can become headmaster of a university.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,happy][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Principal Whiskers is soooo cute.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] And Whiskers U is quickly becoming the most #popular Uni of the city.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] I get your point, but this seems more like #a prank than anything else.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I can't blame you for thinking that. You #haven't seen Boss yet. Let me just...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] BOSS! THE NEWS HERE SAYS THAT IMMORTAL #WRESTLER IS STEPPING BACK INTO THE RING![STOPLIP:]

[XS:danaface,worry][XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] Hey, that isn't wrestling.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I needed to get you out of your office, this #was the fastest way.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] Clever. But how would you even know of #Immortal Sugimoto?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I don't.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I just thought 'Immortal' sounds like a good #title for a wrestler.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] ...Clever. I should-[STOPLIP:]
[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] You. Cat ears. Why?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:danaface,eee][XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] Is... everything okay?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Told ya they look real.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:danaface,][XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] This is impossible. There's no way...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,happy][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Ms. Dana has cute and fluffy cat ears! They #look so soft.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] Call me Danya.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Did she just... Just how much is she #enjoying this?)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Danya:[C:C] And as you can see, it's not impossible.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:stelface,baka][XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] This is a bit hard to swallow. Where did #you even get that milk?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Danya:[C:C] From a friend in Saint Alicia. So don't #worry, the milk is completely safe.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:stelface,][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] What about the effects? Are they temporary?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:danaface,worry][XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Danya:[C:C] What? You think I would ask questions #before drinking cat ear milk?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...Touché.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Danya:[C:C] Anyway, I can see that you didn't drink #your milk yet, Jill.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:danaface,closedsmile][XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Danya:[C:C] You'll never grow up if you don't drink #it.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] There's only one thing that would grow and #you know it.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:danaface,][XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Danya:[C:C] I don't think you realize how good you #would look with cat ears. And just imagine how #Fore would react.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (He would probably say "What, did you #believe I'm your son so strongly that you sprouted #a pair of cat ears yourself?")[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Danya:[C:C] You just imagined what he would say, #right?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Damn! I'm too easy to read.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Danya:[C:C] Anyway, I'll call up Iris later. Right now #I need to make some more photos of cat poses for #my sis.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:danaface,worry][XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Danya:[C:C] And no peeking! Laters![XS:danhide,1][SHOW:265,sprite_stella][SHOW:95,sprite_seiwound][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Why did you look specifically at me when #saying that?![STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Your boss looked so cute with those ears, #right Stella?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:stelface,baka][XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] She... looked pretty good with them.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Do you still think it's just a prank?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:stelface,concern][XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] No... I mean, I want to think it's still #just a bad joke, but her ears were real. I don't #know what to think now...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Why do you care in the first place?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:stelface,surprise][XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] Huh?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] What does it concern you that there's milk #that makes you grow cat ears?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:stelface,][XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] Oh. Hmm... I think it's because it makes #these ears become an aesthetic choice.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:stelface,concern][XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] I never got to decide if I wanted them or #not. I was basically born with them.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] In a way, they are like scars. Proof that #it was only thanks to complicated medical #procedures that I was able to live at all.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,sad][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Stella...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] And now you just drink a glass of milk to #get them... It feels... wrong.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:stelface,sad][XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] Like... I don't know. All I ever wanted #was to not be 'the cat boomer' anymore.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] But, if cat ears are just a thing you can #have now, what does that make me?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:stelface,baka][XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] I always thought I just wanted to be #normal... But now I'm afraid of it.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] You feel like you want them gone, but at the #same time you can't live without them... this #feels familiar.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Look, I don't know if this helps, but think #about it. For a long time. You will only regret it #if you rush into things.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] And about your ears. I'm sure nobody will #think less of you if everyone had those ears or if #you were to lose yours.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] They are part of you, but that's all they #are. A part. And only you can decide how big that #part is.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] You shouldn't let anyone or anything make #you feel less for who you are. Especially not a #stiff glass of milk.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] When you put it like that, it does sound #kind of stupid.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,happy][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] You're always overthinking things, Stella. #You're you, that's all that matters to us.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:stelface,][XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] Thank you, both of you. I feel a bit #better already.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] And if it's any consultation, now the world #is ready for you to make the choice if you want #them or not.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:stelface,surprise][XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] Huh? ...Yeah...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:stelface,happy][XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] Yeah, you're right! I finally have a #choice. Thank you again.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Don't mention it. Now, can I get you #anything else?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:stelface][XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] No, thank you. It's about time Sei and I #to be on our way anyway.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,sorry][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Is it already? Where does the time go?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] Come, I'll drive you home. Even though #you've proven that you're faster than my car.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] That was full-sprint. And you were delayed by #that accident.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:stelface,happy][XS:steltalk,1][C:16]Stella:[C:C] No need to be humble now. Goodbye, Jill.[XS:stelhide,1][STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] But I'm not- eh, goodbye, Jill. Hey, wait #up![XS:seihide,1][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I'm fine. I was just- uhh...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:gilface,cods][XS:giltalk,1][C:19]Gillian:[C:C] Hm? Oh, the ears? Chief made me drink #some strange milk she got.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I guessed as much. How do you feel?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:gilface,][XS:giltalk,1][C:19]Gillian:[C:C] Not much different, to be honest. Just #all that subconscious movement on my head is #throwing me off a little.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] You... look surprisingly good with them. #Very cute.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:gilface,fucked][XS:giltalk,1][C:19]Gillian:[C:C] I'll take the compliment, even if I know #you just want to rub it in.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Maaaybe. By the way, where were you?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:gilface,][XS:giltalk,1][C:19]Gillian:[C:C] Boss sent me to send a gift back to her #friend in Saint Alicia.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Iris? Do you know what she sent?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:gilface,cods][XS:giltalk,1][C:19]Gillian:[C:C] She never told me, but when I went to #refill the drink dispenser when I came in today, #the Karmotrine was awfully low.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ......[STOPLIP:]
[XS:gilface,fucked][XS:giltalk,1][C:19]Gillian:[C:C] And I mean surprisingly low even #considering your... generous use of it.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:gilface,surprise][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Are you implying that I use more Karomotrine #than necessary?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] These drinks are expensive and I want people #to feel like they got their money's worth, #Gillian![STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] People come here to forget their troubles #after all, and if more Karmotrine helps them, then #so be it![STOPLIP:]
[XS:giltalk,1][C:19]Gillian:[C:C] Woah, calm down. I'm just joking. No need #to break character.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] *ahem* Right. I'm just a bit... on edge.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:gilface,][XS:giltalk,1][C:19]Gillian:[C:C] I can see that... Anything happen while I #was gone?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Well, a bit. I just have a hard time dealing #with the existence of that milk.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:giltalk,1][C:19]Gillian:[C:C] Not surprising. I see you got yourself a #glass too. You interesed in getting an extra pair #of ears then?[XS:ph,37][E:37][STOPLIP:]


*Interested*
[E:38][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Well, I would lie if I said I didn't at #least think about it.[XS:gilface,surprise][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...What's with that look?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:giltalk,1][C:19]Gillian:[C:C] I'm just surprised you actually did. I #didn't take you for the kind that cares about #aesthetic mods.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I don't, normally. I never got more than a #piercing or two. But the ears just seem... fun.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] And besides, if there's a milk to make them #appear, there's a way to get them removed as #well.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Or the effects might just be temporary in #the first place.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:gilface,][XS:giltalk,1][C:19]Gillian:[C:C] I sure hope so... Are you gonna drink #it?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Not yet. It's still a big decision.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:giltalk,1][C:19]Gillian:[C:C] Fair enough.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:giltalk,1][C:19]Gillian:[C:C] Does it work?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] You'd be surprised. But anyway, I don't #think I can justify such a big change for #something so... useless.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] They are cute, yes, but not much more. And #besides, it feels wrong to get something that's #normally a leftover of a medical treatment.[STOPLIP:]
[XS.gilface,surprise][XS:giltalk,1][C:19]Gillian:[C:C] You put alot of thought into it, huh? #Well, I can't disagree on that account.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I just got to see it from a cat boomers #perspective is all.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] But even if that weren't the case, I don't #really care about aesthetic mods in the first #place.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Yep. And I can play much more![STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I know I'll regret asking, but what else do #you have?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] About 10 terabytes of recorded "work #sounds".[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I should've known. No, I KNEW. Why are you #recording your "work" "sounds"? What do you even #need them for?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (No way she has 10 terabytes... does she?)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,smug][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Ohoho, I didn't think you were so saucy, #Honey. [STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But well, if it's for you... I guess I #might be able to give you some recordings. For a #free drink.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] What?! No, I'm not that desperate.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Yet.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] *ahem* Before this escalates any further, #would you like to drink anything?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I thought you'd never ask! You know me #well enough Honey. Pick out something I would #like.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Sure, let's try.[XS:ph,47][XS:mix,1][E:47][STOPLIP:]

[E:48][STOPLIP:]
[XS:mix,0][RES:][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Here you go.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,heart][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] What's that? Milk? Since when are you #selling milk?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Since today. And don't act like you didn't #steal glances at the glass since you got here.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,sad][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] ...You know too much...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] This isn't normal milk though. Drinking it #makes you grow cat ears, it seems.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,smug][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] What, like a cat boomer? This milk? #Honey, are you pulling my leg?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] You wish. Watch this: HEY GILLINYAN![STOPLIP:]
[XS:giltalk,1][C:19]Gillinyan:[C:C] Don't call me that![STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] No promises. But can you come over for a #second?[STOPLIP:]
[SHOW:95,sprite_doro][SHOW:255,sprite_gil][XS:gilface,][XS:doroface,heart][XS:giltalk,1][C:19]Gillinyan:[C:C] Here I am. What's up?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] ......[STOPLIP:]
[XS:gilface,fucked][XS:giltalk,1][C:19]Gillinyan:[C:C] Don't tell me...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Woah. He really has cat ears.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Told ya so.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:giltalk,1][C:19]Gillinyan:[C:C] So, did you need me for anything #besides showing off those ears?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Nope. You can go now, John.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:gilface,cods][XS:giltalk,1][C:19]Gillinyan:[C:C] That the day comes where I'm glad to #hear that nickname...[XS:gilhide,1][SHOW:185,sprite_doro][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] So, convinced?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Several times over.[XS:ph,49][E:49][STOPLIP:]


*DoroCatify*
[E:50][STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But don't get your hopes up.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] What do you mean?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I'm a lilim. We don't come in cat boomer. #And we process food radically different from #humans.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] There's no chance I'll grow cat ears from #this.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Don't jinx it. And Boss didn't specifically #say it makes you grow cat ears.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] She said it 'makes you at least 3 times #cuter'.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,smug][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Me? Even cuter? I hardly think that's #possible.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But I can't deny I'm intrigued. Well, #time to swallow Honey's milk...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I- ...really should've seen that one #coming.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,heart][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Oh wow. This is actually real milk is it? #I never got to drink any before, so this is a #first for m-[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Huh? Did you trail off?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,sad][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Oh Honey, I feel strange. Something is #happening...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Is it actually working!?)[STOPLIP:]
[SHOW:185,doro_shake][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Uuuaaaahhhhh......[STOPLIP:]
[XS:onigiri,1][XS:doroshake,0][XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Welcome home Meowster.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...Huh?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Hiss there a purroblem?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ......HUH?![STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...Oh. It's just your jammers.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Heh, I got you good. You should see your #face right now. It's Hiss-terical-[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Ok, I admit it, you fooled m- hey, is #everything alright?[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Uhhh, is this still part of the prank? This #won't work a second time, you know?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Woah![STOPLIP:]
[XS:block,1][XS:catify,doro][P:70][XS:doroshake,0][P:20][XS:onigiri,0][XS:soundpop,1][P:60][XS:doroface,dogs][P:25][XS:block,0][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] H- Hey, what just happened? Why are my #jammers on the floor? And why are you looking at #me like that?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] You... might wanna take back what you said #before.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,think][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Huh, what do you mean......[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (So this milk works even on lilim, huh?)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Maybe I went too far with this one...)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,heart][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] No way! I actually grew cat ears?! And #they even move?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,smug][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] How do I look, Honey? How much cuter am #I!?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (...or maybe I was just overreacting.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Hmmm... Hard to say. You ARE cuter, but by #how much... maybe twice as cute?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,angry][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Now I don't know if I should take this as #a compliment or you teasing me. Are you playing #with my feelings?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Why I would never! I'm just saying that you #might've been right. You were so cute already that #the ears had little effect.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] That you would toy with a fair maiden's #heart such as mine without shame... unbelievable.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Fair maiden?)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,smug][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] If this is because of the jammers, I get #it. But you can't deny it was funny.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...Maybe a bit. In any case, how do you #feel?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] They are less intrusive than I imagined. #I'm glad they didn't displace my headband.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Now that you mention it; is that headband #part of your body or just an accessory? I've never #seen you without it.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Kind of both, actually. It's an #accessory, but you have to more or less build it #in.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] See those two slots on there?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] No. There's a pair of fluffy ears in the #way.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Oh yeah, right.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Anyway, I have one more pair directly #under the headband. So it's basically like an #adapter.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Huh... And why are the slots specifically #located on the head?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] That's just how we DFC-72 are built. It's #mostly for aesthetics. [STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But many lilim you find walking around #hide their slots with accessories or covers.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I've even seen lilim hiding them with #huge hairdos, like an afro.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] That explains why I only ever see them so #rarely.[XS:ph,51][E:51][STOPLIP:]


*HeadbandTalk*
[E:52][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] But that makes me wonder about another #thing... Why do you leave yours out?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Oh that's easy. First of all, it's cute.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Of course.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But more importantly, it's part of the #Lilim-positivity movement.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Lilim-positivity movement?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Yep. They're advocating for showing off #our artificiality as a message.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] But don't lilim hate being seen as #artificial?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] That's the point. By willfully showing #off their artificial parts, they want to show the #world that lilim are more than just machines.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Glitch City's one of the only places #where they can do this sort of thing.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,think][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Freedom of expression isn't really a #thing most lilim outside the city have...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] So it's our job to use our freedom to #help change the status quo.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Strange that I never heard about this #movement before.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] It's not really that far spread among #humans, I think. The whole thing happens mostly in #the Collective Source.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Really? Are you able to talk with other #lilim there?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Not exaaactly. So you know that we #regularly upload our consciousness to the #Collective Source?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Yes. I think it was so you can be #redeployed, should something happen to your body, #right?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Right. And when we throw our data into #the pile, it kind of... mixes with the rest.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] And by becoming part of the collective #consciousness, it's easy for ideas to be spread #all around the world in a matter of days.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] And that's how the idea of the #Lilim-positivity movement was spread?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Exactly![STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But taking part is still up to the #individual lilim. [STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] And even if I wanted every lilim to #follow the movement's example, it's better this #way.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Huh, why?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Because there's no better proof of our #autonomy than having different opinions despite #having the same information.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I... never thought about it like that. #That's some great insight.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] The Collective Source is such a fascinating #topic, but whenever I try to read up on it, I end #up understanding nothing or falling asleep.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Yeah... it's a very complicated subject. #Even we lilim have problems understanding it #sometimes.[XS:ph,53][E:53][STOPLIP:]


*DoroEars*
[E:54][STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,angry][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But Honey, aren't you forgetting #something very important?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Huh? What did I forget?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] They're cute, fluffy, and rhyme with hat #gears.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] They're pretty hard to ignore, let alone #forget, with all that twitching.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Good! You know, I didn't think I was #gonna get a pair of cat ears today.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Would honestly be a strange thing to #expect.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But now that I have them I feel like they #were always a part of me.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (She certainly looks happy about them...)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,smug][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Honey, you know I'll let you stare all #you want but if you do it any harder, you might #bore a hole in them.[STOPLIP:]
[SHAKE:][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] -!![STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Ah, sorry. They just draw in my eyes and #don't let go.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ......no.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,heart][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Don't tell me I hit the nail on the head! #I was only half-serious.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Well... everyone seems to be having so much #fun because of them. And they're cute.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Very.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] So what are you waiting for? You have the #glass right there.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I don't know if I should...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,smug][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] What, are you a scaredy-cat?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] *PFFT*[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Fair enough. You win. But maybe I should #pour myself another glass... This one is a few #hours old already...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] But then again, I don't have the kind of #money to pay for one myself...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I thought today every drink is free?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Really? Now that you mention it...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Why hasn't Boss mentioned that before?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,angry][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Don't change the subject, Honey.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Drink. The. Milk.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Okay, okay. Don't look at me like that.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Well... here goes.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ......wow, this IS great milk![STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Told ya so.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I've not had such good milk in ages. It #doesn't even taste stale at all.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] So you had milk like this in the past?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Not the cat ears materializing kind, but #real milk, yeah. In my childhood.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] A lot actually. Although I remember stopping #sometime in middle school.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Why?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Just a general feeling of being too cool for #child-stuff. Milk didn't fit into my 'image'.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Ohhh. Is it secret lore time?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I... don't think so. It wasn't too #interesting. And I'd rather not remember that #time.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Because the interesting part of your life #started when you met me.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Sure. Let's go with that. Anyway, as I was #say-!![STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,heart][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Huh? Is it beginning?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C][SHAKE:] Irrgh...... Yesszzzzz-......[STOPLIP:]

[XS:doroface,heart][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C][SHAKE:] Urgh... that, certainly, was an experience I #won't forget.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...Okay, you staring at the top of my head #coupled with the weird feeling from that same #place tells me that the milk worked.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Ho boy, has it ever![STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...[STOPLIP:]

[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Shush. I'm talking to your ears now.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...do they really look that good?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Are you kidding me!? Wait, let's ask the #audience...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:block,1][XS:soundOn,0][XS:doroface,pachi]Audience(?):[XS:soundcheer,1] *cheering and applauding* [P:165] [XS:block,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:soundOn,1][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Very funny.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Honey, you should see yourself. You were #cute before, but now- Now 'cute' is an #understatement![STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] You're reaching levels of cute that were #previously deemed impossible![STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Physically speaking, you being this cute #is making-[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I get it, I look cute. Can you please keep #the embarrassing exaggerations to yourself?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,angry][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Exaggerations!? I wouldn't dream of it! #But fine, some just can't seem to handle the soft, #fluffy truth.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] If that will make you stop talking about my #ears.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] No.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But we can temporarily shift the topic.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Do I really look that good with cat ears?)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] So, how do they feel?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Wha- That's still about my ears![STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,smug][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Sorry, I lied. I can't stop.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] *sigh* Well, they feel... strange. In a good #way though.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] What do you mean?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Hmm, how to describe it... They feel odd, #out-of-place. But not unpleasant.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] A bit like they're massaging my head if that #makes sense.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Yeah, I think I get it. So you like #them?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Yeah, yeah. They feel nice.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Yay! I'm glad I pressured you into #drinking potentially dangerous substances then.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Much.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Besides, she was the one that paid for the #glass that I drank.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,smug][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Is that so?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] In that case, I should thank her. And you #should, too.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I guess I should...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Great, I'll quickly get her.[XS:dorohide,1][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Wait, Dorothy, don't-[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Hey Dana![STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Danya:[C:C] That's Danya, you- oh hey Dorothy, what can #I do ya for? Great ears by the way.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Likewise. I just wanted to thank you for #paying for Honey's glass of milk.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] And she wanted to thank you too.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Danya:[C:C] Wait, do you mean she-[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Oh would you look at the time. I really #should be going. Bye, Danya.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Uhh... bye?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Wha-... did she just say "Wink"?)[STOPLIP:]
[SHOW:185,sprite_dana][XS:danaface,worry][XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Danya:[C:C] ...[STOPLIP:]

[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Danya:[C:C] ...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Boss?[STOPLIP:]

[XS:danaface,][XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Danya:[C:C] How do you feel?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Fine, I guess.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Danya:[C:C] Good. We'll have to take some photos for #the occasion later.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...I'm not photogenic.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Danya:[C:C] But your ears are.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] If you talk Gil into it I'll think about #it.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Danya:[C:C] Deal. GILLINYAAAN![XS:danhide,1][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Let's hope she can't persuade him.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (But I do want a picture of Gillinyan...)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (No use overthinking it. Let's just wait for #now.)[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ......[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (These ears are really distracting.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (But not in a bad way...)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] Am I disrupting anything?[STOPLIP:]
[SHAKE:][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] -!![STOPLIP:]

*JillRefuse*
[E:58][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I like looking at them, sure, but jealous? #No, I don't think so.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Really? Not even a bit?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I'm interested in knowing what they feel #like, but not enough to get them myself.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I don't know. They look cute and fun, but I #can't see myself getting a pair of them.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] That's a shame. You would look great with #cat ears.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Are you sure? They seem so... kitschy.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I'm not really one for cutesy stuff like #that. That's more your thing.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Honey, I think you're underselling how #cute you are.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,smug][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Again.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I'm not- Look, of the two us, you're way #cuter. And of the two of us, you have the cat #ears.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I see no problem.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But there's never enough cat ears![STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Besides. If we're only talking cutesy #then the ears wouldn't look right on you.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] So why ar-[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] BUT. You're cute in a different way.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] You're always calm and collected, cold #even.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But sometimes you say something kind and #thoughtful. And these moments feel much more #heartwarming then.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Some people would call you a "Kuudere" #because of those traits.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Kuudere? Wait, is that anime-lingo? Like #Tsundere?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Oh you know it already? Saves me an #explanation.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] --![STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Shit! Slip of the tongue.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] No, I... W-well, why do YOU know those #anyway?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I need to, for my job.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] In case a customer asks for a specific #type of roleplay. Being uninformed turns business #away.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Damn, that's a good reason.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] And how do you know?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I... uh, I read it somewhere. Can't walk #around Glitch City without picking up a bit of #that stuff, you know?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] True enough. There's lots of anime fans #in the city for some reason.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] *ahem* Just how many Dere are there?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Oh there's loads! [STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But the most well-known ones are #Tsundere, Kuudere and Yandere.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] And in case you're wondering, I'm a #Deredere, because I'm always cheerful and cute.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] What? You made that up! You're more of a...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] You're a DOROdere! Heh.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,smug][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Dorodere are characters that have #psychopathic tendencies, Honey.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...of course they are. Is there a Dere for #literally everything?![STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I told you, there's loads.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...yes, but this is getting ridiculous.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,think][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But that reminds me of that time I was #asked to roleplay as a Yandere.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Yandere? You mentioned that before.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Yandere are basically psychos that kill #for their lover's affection.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Ugh... And people are into that stuff?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Hey now Honey, don't kink shame.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...I don't know, that sounds like a #dangerous preference.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] That's why they come to us to roleplay #it. It's fine, normally.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Normally?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Yeah... however there was that one #particular guy who was the exception.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] He paid a good sum in advance to have me #kill some other lilim he roped in.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (The way she says this so nonchalantly...)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] The plan was that they'd go on a date #together and that I should show up later.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] My job was to barge into his home and #pretend to kill his date.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Pretend to kill?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Yeah. Insult her while I dismembered her. #I was told she was a professional, so I saw little #to complain about.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] That sounds extremely out-of-character for #you.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Oh, it totally was. I had to practice a #lot at home to sound convincing.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Anyway, so I was dismembering her bit by #bit, and all I can think of is that the girl's #acting is shockingly believable.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] So at some point, I took out her phone, #just as part of the act.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I got the code out of her to unlock it #and looked at her photos, which I was told were #prepared in advance as well.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,think][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] So as I look through her photos, I see #the both of them together on some pictures that #date back 3 years ago.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] What?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] As it turns out I was dismembering not a #professional escort, but his actual girlfriend.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] No way! What did you do?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Firstly, I was shocked. But then I rushed #to reassemble her while I told her what was #supposed to happen.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] What did the guy do?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] After I told him that I would do the same #to him for lying to me, he ran with his tail #between his legs.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Literally, as he was completely naked.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I still reported him to the White #Knights, but I don't know what became of him after #that.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] And the lilim girl?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] After apologizing profusely, I gave her #the money from the job for therapy.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] And now, a year later, I still keep in #touch with her.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] She's gotten much better.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I'm just happy it didn't end any worse.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Me too. Oh, I should take her around #sometime.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] *sigh*[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I may be the bartender, but now I feel like #I need a drink.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Like this glass of milk right here?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I'm tempted...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] But no. If anything, I need alcohol.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] It was worth a try.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Anyway, it's about time for me to start #my shift.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] It is? Oh, I didn't notice.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Well, goodbye you... Catdere.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] It's Nyandere.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...of course it is.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Goodbye Honey.[XS:dorohide,1][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] *mumble* ...bye.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Well, if I don't intend to drink it anyway, #I might just remove that glass from the counter.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (It's too tempting otherwise...)[XS:ph,59][E:59][STOPLIP:]


*Drink1Woman*

[XS:mix,0][RES:][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Here you go.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Yaaay! A Piano Woman. No one knows me #like you, Honey![STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Glad I could be of service. But I'm not the #person that knows you best, am I?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] You probably are, apart from my mo- #guardian. Is that strange?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Not strange, just surprising. I'm just your #bartender after all.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But you're fun and cute. And easy to #tease. And you make great drinks.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] What was that just now?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] And like my guardian likes to say: #"Alcohol is only as good as the people you're #with."[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...I suppose that's true. Unless you're #alone. Or... maybe even then.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Anyway, thanks for the drink Honey.[XS:ph,61][E:61][STOPLIP:]

[XS:mix,0][RES:][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Here you go.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] A sweet drink. Thank you very much.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] It's kinda obvious what you meant by #"Something you'd like", don't you think?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Maybe, but I'm still happy to see that #you actually remembered.[XS:ph,63][E:63][STOPLIP:]

[XS:doroface,sad][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Honeyyyy. This isn't sweet! What did I do #to you to deserve this?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] What would you say if I told you that I did #it intentionally?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,angry][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I would ask you why. And choose your next #words carefully.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ......[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Variety is the spice of life.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I can't stand spiciness.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Just drink it. And be honest to yourself. #Who knows, you might like it after all.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,think][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] ...hmm....[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,smug][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] It's awful.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Well, I tried.[XS:ph,65][E:65][STOPLIP:]


*DoroNoEars*
[E:66][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Say, about your recorder...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Voicebox.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Huh?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] It's my voicebox. Everything I say is #coming from there, not just recordings.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Oh, I didn't know that. Do all lilim have #the ability to record things?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Generally yes. But it's not automatically #unlocked for most of them.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Only work lilim have it when they #deploy.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] So you didn't? How did you unlock it?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] It was pretty easy. There's video #tutorials for it out there.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Wait really? And that's legal?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Well, if you go through with it you lose #your warranty and can't have it be repaired or #replaced at an official store.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] That doesn't sound like too much of a #drawback.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] It isn't, but many lilim just don't trust #Ripperdocs should something happen.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Now that you mention it, I wouldn't want to #get under their knife either. Especially if I #couldn't even talk.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Right? And buying a new one is also #something nobody wants to do.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Huh, why? Are they that expensive?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] That too, but they're impossible to #calibrate without special tools.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] And even just the smallest difference in #calibration will make your voice sound noticeably #different.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] So you either get a completely new voice #or go to a Ripperdoc again. And that's still not #counting the money required.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...okay, I take it back. That IS a lot of #drawbacks.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] So why did you do it then?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] For my job. And safety, broadly #speaking.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] In case someone muggs you while you're #defenseless?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Theoretically, yes. [STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,smug][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But in that case, I have more... active #ways of fighting back.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] No, it's more to defend myself legally.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Many escorts started making contracts for #their clients to save themselves from people #trying to cheat their way out of paying.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But I don't like that. It makes the sex #feel like business.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I mean, it is. But it should feel fun and #easy. That's what keeps my business up.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Makes sense. So instead you use recordings?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Yes. I tell my clients beforehand of #course, but there's no weight of obligations and #signatures to the whole thing.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] That way, I can also sell the recording #to the customer, should they want it.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Recording everything and selling it to #people? Maybe she should meet with a certain #Streamer...)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But that doesn't mean that they won't try #to get some free sex regardless.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] There was this one guy a few months ago #that accused me of doctoring the voice recording.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,angry][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] "No way I agreed to that price. How dumb #do you take me for?"[XS:doroface,] he said.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] So what did he do?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] He took the recording to a professional #to have it inspected. [STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] In the end, the professional told him #that the recording was clean.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Not only that, but the man didn't even #realize that the cost for the audio inspection was #almost as high as what he would've saved.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] How did he not notice that?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I'm not sure, but I suspect he thought #inspections that found nothing were free. [STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] So in the end, he had to pay almost twice #as much.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Serves him right.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] That reminds me of that one guy that accused #us of mixing addictive substances into the drinks #to lure him to come back. [STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Screamed and shouted his rhetoric into the #street too.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Oh wow. What happened next? Did he take #the drink to a chemist?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Huh? No. Boss told him that she was gonna #punch the addiction out of him free of charge if #he wanted.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] He was surprisingly quiet after that.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,smug][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] What a tool. It's obvious that the only #addictive thing in this bar is you, Honey.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Is that so? I think I know a way to remedy #that.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Don't glare at me like that. I know you #won't hit me.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] And why is that?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Because you love me![STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] And because I would most definitely break my #hand.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Tomayto, tomahto.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But I feel like having another drink.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Sure, what can I get you?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Surprise me again![STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ... I could. Or you could just tell me that #you want a glass of milk. You've been glancing at #it since you arrived.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,angry][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] So you noticed since the beginning and #decided to give me something else anyway?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] There's a good reason for it.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I'd love to hear that reason.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] The milk seems to cause people to grow cat #ears.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,smug][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] What, like a cat boomer? That milk? #Honey, are you pulling my leg?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] You wish. Watch this: HEY GILLINYAN![STOPLIP:]
[XS:giltalk,1][C:19]Gillinyan:[C:C] Don't call me that![STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] No promises. But can you come over for a #second?[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Told ya so.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:giltalk,1][C:19]Gillinyan:[C:C] So, did you need me for anything #besides showing off those ears?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Nope. You can go now, John.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Okay, let's wait this out...)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I thought at least YOU were different, #but alas! Never shall I ever find-[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Hey, are you even listening?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Unfortunately, yes. Now, can you please-[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] One second.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Never shall I ever find true happiness in #life. How pitiable.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...are you done?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Yep, I'm done.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Okay. What I wanted to say is: "I'm sorry."[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Oh you don't need to apologize.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Huh?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Would I have wanted milk that makes me #grow cat ears?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Yes.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But am I the bartender dealing with a #potentially dangerous substance?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] No. And I don't envy your position, #Honey.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Wow. That's pretty reasonable of you.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,smug][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Hey, I know what I look like but that's #no reason to treat me like a child.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,angry][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Also, just because I get you doesn't mean #I'm not still mad about not getting any cat ear #milk.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] There isn't even any guarantee it would even #work on you.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I know, but![STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But cat ears.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I'll keep a glass cool for you for when I #know it's safe to drink, okay?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Yaay! Pouting wins agai- I mean, you're #the best Honey![STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] *sigh* I know.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But that leaves one question.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Why do you still have the glass out there #if you don't want to serve me milk anyway?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] That's... actually a very good question.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Boss had me keep the glass out so that #customers could see it but also for me to drink #it.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] But with how things are right now, I don't #think I'll serve NOR drink it today.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I should just put it away.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Before you do that, do you want me to #take care of it?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] What do you mean?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Well, what if you dispose of the milk and #it get's into the ground water? Cat ears #everywhere.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] It would be a total Cat-astrophe.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Did you just-[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] So I'll take care of it for you. You #can't leave the bar, right?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I'll just go out and destroy it with my, #uhh, reactor-core. Will only take a minute. #Whaddya say?[XS:ph,71][E:71][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (The cat ears were fun, I can't deny that.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (But all things considered, they also did #some heavy damage.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (I almost wonder if this is just how things #are or if I could've changed anything.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:anface,smug][XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] Most people are only disappointed when you #deny them their orders.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] Like me.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Don't you guilt-trip me after what you #pulled on your first visit.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:anface,][XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] Okay, okay.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:anface,sad][XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] Yeesh. Way to hold a grudge.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:anface,][XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] So would you want the milk to be gone #entirely?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Gone? Hmm...)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (It should not be us to handle it at #least.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (This might be a city where you can just buy #new cyber-eyes from vending machines, but we're #just some random dive bar.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (It's my job to serve people substances that #limit their critical thinking. Not the best #conditions.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (I just don't be the one to make the final #decision on who gets to have cat ears and who #doesn't.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] Wouldn't impulse purchases help the bottom #line though?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Yes. In the short term. Imagine waking up #with cat ears and no idea what happened the night #before though.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:anface,sad][XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] ...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] I take it back.[XS:ph,87][E:87][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Not in a bad way, but still.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (While everything worked out in the end, I #can't help but feel like this milk is too... #powerful, for lack of a better term.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Like one misstep might've lead to #disaster...)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:anface,happy][XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] But it didn't and that's worth something, at #least.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:anface,][XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] And you? Not interested in cat ears?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (I'd be lying if I said I wasn't, but...)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (It's too big a decision to make on the #spot.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:anface,smug][XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] That sounds painfully like something you'd #say.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Thank... you? Or was that an insult?)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] It was me reading you like a book even more #than normal.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:anface,][XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] What if I told you that today is your only #chance?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (What do you mean? Sure, it's organic milk, #but the bar dispenser should keep it fresh for a #good while.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:anface,away][XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] Look, how about this. You drink the milk so #that I can see you with cat ears and I'll tell you #why the day has been so strange.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Why the day has been so strange? ...it HAS #been strange hasn't it?)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:anface,][XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] You might even say it feels disconnected #from your usual experience here.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...hmmm[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] *sigh*[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Fine, I'll do it.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:anface,smugsmile][XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] I knew you'd come around.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:anface,happy][XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] Oh! Speaking of which! Since I'll be the one #serving you, you should come to this side of the #counter.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Oh no. No, no, no. I'll not do that again.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jillface,uh][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (I think I felt all my molecules get #rearranged just now...)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] Oh, zip it. It'll all be worth it in the #end, trust me.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (...I want to order.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] Milk, right?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (No... I want enough alcohol to blackout and #forget the whole day, please.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] Sorry, we only serve milk today.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] So, what can I serve you?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (....milk, please.)[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Telling me why this day is so strange.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] Huh? You think I'll bail on you?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] It's more likely that I won't leave your #side once you have cat ears.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jillface,baka][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (That would be even worse.)[STOPLIP:]

[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] Holy shit. You look stunning. Stunninger.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] Forcing me, she says. I didn't even touch #you.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] But now I feel like petting you.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jillface,uh][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (I'd prefer you didn't.)[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (...where else would we be?)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] Don't you think it's a bit strange?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] You don't remember getting here, have never #taken a break, and started serving supernatural #milk that defies all logic.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jillface,surprise][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (How do you-)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] How do I, indeed. I shouldn't know most of #these things. Yet I do.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jillface,baka][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] In that case, I guess I can talk normally #with you.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] But... what does that mean? That the whole #day today was fake?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] In a way, yes. When you wake up, nobody will #know what happened.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jillface,think][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] That's fine.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] You're really making it easy for you, y'know #that?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] It IS easy. I don't need any proof to have #something FEEL real.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] And today... well, let's say I felt a lot of #things.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] Yep, you've gone crazy. Calling a dream #real.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Maybe.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] And what does this dream even say about #you?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jillface,uh][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] That... I like cat ears?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] More like that you're absolutely obsessed #with them.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Who isn't?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:antalk,1][C:41]Anna:[C:C] Most people, Jo. You might be the only one.[STOPLIP:]
