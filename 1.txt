*Start*
Dana: Jill, are you here yet? The bar opens in a few minutes.
Jill: Huh, what?
Dana: Gil already cleaned the glasses, we're just waiting on you.
Jill: I- I'm here.
Dana: There you are. And right on time.
Jill: G'eveni-... What?
Dana: Something wrong?
Jill: Ignoring the fact that I don't have any recollection on how I even got here...
Jill: Why do you have cat ears, Boss?
Dana: Because they are cute and cool.
Jill: No, I meant: Why do YOU have cat ears?
Dana: Because of the milk.
Jill: What are you-
Jill: ...
Jill: Why is there milk in the bar dispenser? Wait, is that real milk? Where did you even get that?
Dana: It was a gift from Iris. 'Everyone that drinks this milk gets at least three times cuter' she said. Can't argue with results.
Jill: (...Can't argue, indeed.)
Dana: Hey, no staring unless you give me something to stare at too.
Dana: Here, drink up. It's on the house.
Jill: You expect me to just drink something that might make me grow cat ears for no reason? Are you sure it's safe?
Dana: Hey, be happy I told you what it does before you drank it. And don't worry, it's been thoroughly tested.
Jill: Wait, what does that mean? Did you-
Dana: Anyway, leave it out. That way customers can see it. But don't feel shy about drinking it yourself. I'll be in my office.
Jill: Yeah, yeah...
Jill: (I've had many strange days lately, but today feels different.)
Jill: Time to mix drinks and change lives.
Jill: (Huh, strange. I don't see Gil anywhere. Getting supplies maybe?)
Sei: Ah, haa...haa. So I was faster after all.
Jill: ...Welcome to Valhalla, Sei. You sound like you ran a marathon.
Sei: I- haa... I did. Stella challenged me who'd be here faster- haa... me running or her, driving.
Jill: And you WON? In your condition? Wow...
Sei: Eh, I think you have it wrong. Haa- Stella lives uptown, remember? And then there's also the- haa... the traffic around this time.
Jill: Still, that's impressive... scary, almost. Wait, does that mean you ran a whole district here?
Sei: Something- haa... like that. Nothing I wouldn't be able to- haa... run were I not so out of shape.
Jill: You? Out of shape? What do you call ME then?
Sei: Jill, probably. Haa... But please don't make such a big- haa... deal out of it. This would've only been the warm-up back in the bootcamps.
Jill: (And I maintain: Impressive and scary.)
Jill: ...Ok then, care for a celebratory drink?
Sei: Sounds great, but just water for n- ...Is that milk?
Jill: (Oh no.)
Jill: Yes... it's milk. Real one at that. But it seems to have some... side-effects.
Sei: Side-effects? Like causing flank pain? I don't think you have to worry, my torso's pretty tough. My instructor always told me-
Jill: Not that kind of- No, it seems to make you grow cat ears.
Sei: Cat ears? Like Stella?
Jill: Pretty much. I don't know the details, but I saw Boss with cat ears today. And they seemed too real to be a prank. But...
Sei: What? That sounds so cute. I wish I could've seen her.
Sei: You know, I always wondered what it's like to have cat ears. They look so soft. I'll take one milk, please.
Jill: ...Coming right up.


*SeiCat1* 
Jill: One glass of milk.
Sei: Thank you.
Jill: So? How is it?
Sei: ...........
Jill: Hello, Earth to Sei? Sei something, say.
Sei: Wh- what? Oh, sorry. This milk made some memories flood back in.
Jill: Judging from your expression, I'm guessing it wasn't the happy kind?
Sei: Yes and no. Some were happy, some were not. But all memories are welcome.
Sei: Mostly just stuff from when Stella and I were kids. The usual adventures and fights. 
Sei: But also some ...darker moments.
Jill: ...
Sei: But it's those memories that make us who we are today. And thanks to this milk, I was able to relive those memories.
Sei: This is my first glass in quite a whiole. Back then, we drank a lot of milk. Stellas parents made sure of that. I almost feel like-
Sei: Ahaha-..... Oww... haha...ow
Jill: Hey, what's going on? ...BOSS, SEI'S IN TROUBLE!
Dana: DID SHE DRINK THE MILK?
Jill: YES, WHAT ARE YOU-
Sei: Hwah? What's going on? ...Why do you look so surprised?
Jill: (This can't be. The milk...)
Sei: ....
Sei: I have cat ears! Jill, can you see them?
Jill: I.... yes...
Sei: Do they look as fluffy as they feel like?
Jill: They do look fluffy. Similar to Fore's.
Sei: I can't wait to see Stellas reaction.


*SeiNoCat1* 
Sei: This isn't milk...
Jill: I just don't know the possible health-risks yet... sorry.
Sei: I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked so selfishly for something that may be dangerous.
Jill: Don't worry about it. I'll ask Boss about it later.


*Main1* 
Sei: .....
Sei: She was always embarassed about them, you know?
Jill: Really? It feels more like her whole appearance is based on proudly presenting then.
Sei: Actually, it's the opposite. She's presenting them to distract from them. Make them seem like the most normal thing in the world.
Sei: She hates to be seen as different from the others. And if everybody acknowledges them from the first moment, she's just a girl.
Jill: I didn't think there were people that discriminate against Cat Boomers in Glitch City...
Sei: There are a few, but it's not her appearance towards others she's afraid of.
Sei: I guess you could say it's also her parents' fault in a way. She told me that she was always presented as their 'cat boomer daughter'...
Sei: She must've felt like it was her whole identity.
Jill: And that's why she started dressing so flashy?
Sei: Yeah, it was a few years ago, but-
Stella: Of course someone had to be in an accident while I was in a hurry!
Sei: Ah, there you are.
Jill: Welcome to Valhalla, Stella.


*SeiCat2* 
Stella: What? How? Why? Who? ....Huh?!
Sei: Glad to see you finally made it.
Stella: You. Cat ears. Why?
Sei: Oh right, these? They are because of the milk. Wanna feel how soft they are? But be careful, they're still sensitive.
Stella: Jill. Help.
Jill: Well, I can't tell you what I don't know, but Boss got some milk from a friend and it seems to make people grow cat ears when they drink it. No idea why.
Stella: And Sei just drank it? You idiot. Who knows what could've happened?
Sei: I was wondering the same, so I decided to test it. Mystery solved!
Jill: And besides, Boss drank it too, so we knew it wouldn't kill or harm her at least.
Stella: With how tough your boss is, I'd imagine she could drink poison and be fine.
Jill: ...Touch√©.
Stella: Why would you do that? Grow a pair of cat ears?
Sei: Because yours seem like fun. And to cheer you up.
Stella: ...Cheer me up?
Sei: You alway seemed so unhappy about them. So I thought, if I got a pair too...
Sei: ...you wouldn't feel so alone anymore...
Sei: Sorry, I shouldn't have assumed-
Stella: ...diot.
Sei: What was that?
Stella: You IDIOT! You...you cat-eared dummy!
Sei: Eh?
Stella: You would risk your well-being just to make me feel better about myself?
Sei: Is that so strange?
Stella: There are less dangerous way to go about it Sei!
Sei: But that's what best friends are for, right?
Stella: .......
Stella: You... how could I ever feel alone with you around?
Jill: (It never gets boring with those two.)
Jill: Would you like to drink something, Stella?
Stella: Yeah... I think I'll have-
Sei: Hey Jill, what would happen if Stella drank the the Milk?
Jill: I... actually have no idea. And I don't know if we should test it.
Sei: What's the worst that could happen? Stella already has cat ears. And the milk is really tasty.
Jill: (Can't say I'm not interested to see what would happen.)
Stella: Well, you did win the race, so I owe you a prize...
Stella: Jill, you decide.
Jill: Huh?
Stella: Get me either a Fringe Weaver or the milk.
Jill: ...No problem.


*SeiNoCat2*
Stella: So you got here before me, huh?
Sei: Yes, I've been here a little while already.
Stella: Not surprising, considering what happened on the way here.
Jill: You mentioned an accident?
Stella: Yes. On the ride here the cab in front of us seemed to have malfunctioned.
Stella: It drove into an intersection and collided with another car.
Sei: Oh no, that sounds horrible! You should've called me.
Stella: There was no need. Thanks to you drilling all those first-aid techniques into my skull I was able to keep the inquired woman stable until help arrived.
Stella: And I guess I must've done a good job, because one of the ambulance workers called me "Doctor".
Sei: See, I told you they would come in handy sometime.
Stella: And besides, you have to fully heal yourself before jumping into action again. See, if I just poke here...
Sei: Owch! But my injuries were probably nothing compared to hers. And I'm used to pain.
Stella: I don't want to hear you say that.
Sei: Anyway, I'm glad you were on the scene to provide first aid. For that, I'll buy you a drink, "Ms. Doctor".
Stella: You make it sound like that's my last name. Now let's see...
Jill: (I can guess what she'll ask next.)
Stella: I'll take a milk, please.
Jill: Why yes, it is. Boss got it from- Huh?
Stella: One milk please.
Jill: Are you sure? That milk seems to make people grow cat ears. I don't know how or why, but unless Boss is playing an elaborate prank, that's a thing that might happen.
Stella: What? Grow cat ears? Are you making fun of me?
Jill: No, I- When I came here, I saw Boss with cat ears. I was just as surprised as you.
Stella: Sorry, I know you wouldn't....
Stella: I've decided. I want a milk anyway.
Jill: Huh? Are you sure?
Stella: I already have cat ears, so there's not much that could happen. And looking at that glass made me thirsty for milk.
Jill: (Maybe we should leave drinks out in the open more often.)
Jill: Ok, one milk for Stella.


*SeiAndStella*
Jill: Here you go. One glass of milk.
Stella: So your curiosity got the better of you after all?
Jill: (She noticed?!)
Stella: Well, it looks like milk.... Let's see if it's as tasty as you say.
Stella: ........
Stella: I see. So this is real milk after all. It's not something I get to enjoy often.
Jill: Do you like it?
Stella: It's delicious. And it seems to have an nostalgic aftertaste...
Sei: What? Mine didn't have an aftertaste. Is it spoiled?
Stella: No, I mean that the milk made me remember a few things from the past.
Sei: Oh. Yeah, that happened to me too. Right before-


*OnlyStella*
Jill: Here you go. One glass of milk.
Stella: So your curiosity got the better of you after all?
Jill: (She noticed?!)
Stella: Well, it looks like milk.... Let's see if it tastes like it too.
Stella: ........
Stella: I see. So this is real milk after all. It's not something I get to enjoy often.
Jill: Do you like it?
Stella: It's delicious. And it seems to have an aftertaste of nostalgia...
Sei: Aftertaste? Do you think it's spoiled?
Stella: No, I mean that the milk made me remember a few things from the past.
Sei: Really? I remember that you told me you drank a lot of milk in the-


*StellaCatify*
Stella: Hnnnng...... owwwww- ......ugh
Jill: What, she's having a reaction?!
Sei: I'll hold her so she doesn't hurt herself!
Stella: Huff... The pain seems to have subsided.
Stella: What's wrong?
Jill: (Did she... get a second pair of ears?)
Sei: Now you're twice as cute and fluffy!
Stella: What do you- ...
Stella: ............
Stella: Please tell me I'm imagining things, but it feels as if I have two pairs of cat ears on my head.
Jill: That's.... what it looks like to me.
Stella: This... can't be.
Sei: Hey, are you okay? You look like you're going to faint.
Jill: Here, take this water and try to calm down. Deep breaths.
Stella: Huff..... huff..... huff...
Jill: Better?
Stella: ....A bit. Thank you.
Jill: Don't mention it.
Jill: Still, it seems like you have a smaller pair of cat ears in addition to your usual ones now.
Stella: ...I... can't be seen like this.
Sei: I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have asked you to drink the milk. I didn't mean to...
Stella: It's not your fault. No one could have known.
Stella: ...Jill, get me another milk.
Jill: Hwha-?
Stella: If one milk gets me a new pair, a second one might reverse the effect.
Sei: Are you sure?
Jill: Yeah... What if you just grow another pair?
Stella: I know. But I have to try regardless. It can't get much worse...
Stella: Jill, if you would.
Jill: ...Sure.


*NoEarStella*
Jill: One milk. I hope this works.
Stella: There's only one way to find out.
Stella: .....
Sei: And? How do you feel?
Stella: Not much different yet. It seems to take a while until the milk sets in.
Sei: Oh yeah.
Sei: .....
Stella: .....
Jill: .....
Jill: (The atmosphere suddenly became so thick. We're all just... waiting.)
Stella: Hnnrg.... rrrrng...
Sei: I got you!
Jill: (Now, let's see...)
Stella: Hrrm... the second time wasn't as bad as the first.
Stella: Hey what are you staring at?
Jill: (What the hell is this milk you sent us, Iris?)
Sei: You look... strange, Stella.
Stella: What do you mean, strange? Wait....
Stella: They're gone. Both pairs, without a trace.
Jill: How do you feel?
Stella: I... don't know. But I'm not a freak anymore, so... relieved? But why did you say I look strange?
Sei: It's hard to explain, but you seem... off. You don't look like yourself.
Stella: I don't look like myself?
Jill: I think what Sei means is that your ears were such a big part of your appearance that seeing you without them feels wrong, in a way.
Stella: Were my ears that important?


*RolesReversed*
Sei: And now I'm the one with cat ears.
Jill: ...You're right. Your roles are more or less reversed now.
Stella: It's true. What a strange turn of events.
Sei: I'm the cat girl meow.
Stella: Don't... No cat puns.
Sei: Hehe. You look better already, Stella. Don't be so gloomy.
Jill: It's hard to sulk with Sei around. I had that experience first-hand.
Stella: Fine, fine. I'm okay. It's just-
Stella: There were times when I wished my ears were gone, but... they're still a part of me. Now that I got rid of them... I kinda miss them.
Stella: Don't get me wrong. There's no way I was going to keep two pairs, but if I were to decide... I think I'd want them back.
Jill: If you want, I can serve you another milk.
Stella: ...No thanks. There's too many uncertainties right now. Besides, the milk's effect could be only temporary.
Jill: That's fair. I need to ask Boss about it later.
Stella: Thank you. And I think for now I should enjoy the role reversal. I'll worry about what comes next later.
Sei: Yay! I'm the soft and fluffy one now.
Stella: The ears maybe. I'm not so sure about the rest.
Sei: Wh- What do you mean by that?
Stella: Nothing, now let's get going. Bye, Jill.
Sei: What, already? Hey, don't shove me. Uhh, bye, Jill!
Jill: (Seems Stella was able to recover from the initial shock after all. Good for her.)


*NoEarsAtAll*
Sei: Except for your drills. They're still soft and fluffy.
Stella: They are neither soft nor fluffy.
Sei: Are you sure? They have this little bounce when you walk.
Sei: Hmm... what I mean is, even without your ears, there's still soft and fluffy things on you. Because for me, you're always soft and fluffy! Because you're Stella!
Jill: Yeah. Well, not exactly what she said, but it'll take a while for us to get used to it. Even then, you're still the same Stella as always. 
Stella: ...I know. It's just... I don't know...
Stella: There were times when I wished my ears to be gone, but... they're still a part of me. Now that I got rid of them... I kinda miss them. 
Stella: Don't get me wrong. There's no way I was going to keep two pairs, but if I were to decide... I think I'd want them back.
Jill: If you want, I can serve you another milk.
Stella: ...No thanks. There's too many uncertainties right now. Besides, the milk's effect could be only temporary.
Jill: That's fair. I need to ask Boss about it later.
Stella: Thank you. And for now, I should enjoy looking normal for once. I'll worry about what comes next later.
Jill: (I'm sure you'll still stand out with your drills alone...)
Sei: Yay! Girls night! Jill, come with!
Jill: Huh? What, me?
Stella: I'm pretty sure Jill still has work to do.
Sei: Oh, right. Sorry.
Jill: Don't worry about me. I'm fine. But you two have fun.
Stella: Ok, but you'll have to join us next time. No buts!
Jill: Yeah, yeah. If you tell me sooner than the exact moment it starts.
Sei: Oh, Stella. I know where we can go first. I found this hidden antique shop that sells old military equipment. They even have a small box filled with dog tags!
Stella: What, dusty old military equipment? That's what you think of first when you hear 'Girls Night'?
Sei: I know you'll love it. They even have old uniforms you can just put on.
Stella: I guess it might be fun to see you get into some old uniforms. But we should get going, in any case. Bye, Jill.
Sei: But I meant that you should try them on. Hey, wait! Uhh, bye, Jill.
Jill: (Seems Stella was able to recover from the initial shock after all. Good for her.)


*StellaDisappointed*
Jill: I'm sorry... I don't think this is such a good idea. We shouldn't jump to conclusions just yet. For one, the effect of the milk might only be temporary.
Stella: You're... you're right. We should see what happens before doing something so potentially dangerous.
Stella: Thanks, Jill.
Jill: As I said, don't mention it. I'll ask Boss later if she can get something that can reverse the effects, should they be permanent.
Stella: I appreciate it. Well, we better be on our way then. Sei, you want to wait this out with me?
Sei: Ah, yes. I still feel bad for making you do this.
Stella: We'll figure something out. Goodbye, Jill. And don't worry about me.
Sei: Bye, Jill. Sorry for everything.
Jill: (I just hope these two will be okay.)


*Fringe*
Jill: Here you go.
Stella: A Fringe Weaver. I won't complain...


*NoFringe*
Jill: Here you go.
Stella: I... didn't ask for this.
Jill: Oh, I thought you should try something new.


*OnlySei*
Stella: Was there a reason you didn't give me a milk? It seemed like you were really interested in finding out what would happen.
Jill: (She noticed?!)
Jill: Well, I was, but it's a bit too dangerous. We know it worked on Boss and Sei, but who knows what might happen to a cat boomer?
Jill: Granted, the person that sent us the milk is a cat boomer, but with the existence of this milk, that might not even be true in the first place.
Stella: So you're saying anyone could become a cat boomer with this milk...
Sei: That would be so cute. 
Stella: Cute? These ears are nothing but trouble. Just getting my hair in order every morning is troublesome.
Stella: ...why are you exchanging glances?
Stella: Anyway, I've learnt to live with them, but they are more a hindrance than anything else.
Stella: There's a lot of people just staring at them mid-conversation. I know they don't mean anything by it, but it feels like I'm getting reduced to these ears.
Jill: (...I can't deny that I'm guilty of that.)
Stella: Everywhere I go I'm always treated differently. It's hard to notice, but with time you are able to read the faces of those people.
Stella: And I get it. Cat Boomers are pretty rare, so people want to ask questions.
Stella: But they make me feel more like a walking attraction instead of a girl...
Sei: But now I have cat ears too. Now we're both different together, right?
Stella: ...Maybe you're right. Now they won't pester just me alone anymore.
Sei: And there's good things about them too. They are soft and they are fluffy.
Stella: On good days they are, yes.
Stella: And seeing them on you makes me realize why people like to stare. They're hypnotizing!
Jill: (Seeing them almost makes me jealous.)
Stella: But there's one more practical downside to them.
Sei: What's that?
Stella: I can't wear hats. And you remember how much I struggled to squeeze into your helmet.
Sei: Yeah, that makes sense. I can't remember ever seeing you wear a hat for more than a few minutes.
Sei: Oh I have an idea! Let's cut holes in your hats so your ears aren't squished.
Stella: That's such a bad idea! Can you imagine how much even one of them costs?
Sei: More than my whole wardrobe, probably. But that way you would at least get some use out of them.
Stella: I'll think about it, okay? But for now I think we've taken up enough of Jills time with our cat chatter.
Sei: You're probably right. Oh, when I drank the milk, I remembered a funny story from when we were still in school.
Stella: I hope it's not the one I'm thinking of. Is it the one where your festival stand got trashed?
Sei: How did you know?!
Stella: I guess I just know how you tick. Goodbye, Jill.
Sei: Hey, wait up. Bye, Jill.
Jill: Goodbye, you two.
Jill: (Seems that milk made them really happy. Good for them.)


*NoMilkSS*
Jill: Here you go.
Stella: Did you get cold feet halfway through?
Jill: Sorry, I just think that serving this milk is a bad idea.
Stella: Don't tell me you actually believe there's such a thing as milk that makes you grow ears?
Jill: ...Of course not. But what if there IS? This is still Glitch City, the place where a hamster can become headmaster of a university.
Sei: Principal Whiskers is soooo cute.
Jill: And Whiskers U is quickly becoming the most popular Uni of the city.
Stella: I get your point, but this seems more like a prank than anything else.
Jill: I can't blame you for thinking that. You haven't seen Boss yet. Let me just...
Jill: BOSS! NEWS SAY THAT IMMORTAL WRESTLER IS STEPPING BACK INTO THE RING!
Dana: WHAT!? I THOUGHT HE STEPPED DOWN FOR GOOD! I NEED TO SEE THIS!!
Dana: That weasel, he told me he was done himse-
Dana: Hey, that isn't wrestling.
Jill: I needed to get you out of your office, this was the fastest way.
Dana: Clever. But how would you even know Immortal Sugimoto?
Jill: I don't. I just thought 'Immortal' sounds like a good title for a wrestler.
Dana: ....Clever. I should-
Stella: You. Cat ears. Why?
Dana: Is... everything okay?
Jill: Told ya they look real.
Stella: This is impossible. There's no way...
Sei: Ms. Dana has cute and fluffy cat ears! They look so soft.
Dana: Call me Danya.
Jill: (Did she just... Just how much is she enjoying this?)
Danya: And as you can see, it's not impossible.
Stella: This is a bit hard to swallow. Where did you even get that milk?
Danya: From a friend in Saint Alicia. So don't worry, the milk is completely safe.
Jill: What about the effects? Are they temporary? 
Danya: What? You think I would ask questions before drinking cat ear milk?
Jill: ...Point taken.
Danya: Anyway, I can see that you didn't drink your milk yet, Jill.
Danya: You'll never grow up if you don't drink it.
Jill: There's only one thing that would grow and you know it.
Danya: I don't think you realize how good you would look with cat ears. And just imagine how Fore would react.
Jill: (He would probably say "What, did you believe I'm your son so strongly that you sprouted a pair of cat ears yourself?")
Danya: You just imagined what he would say, right?
Jill: (Shit! I'm too easy to read.)
Danya: Anyway, I'll call up Iris later. Right now I need to make some more photos of cat poses for my sis.
Danya: And no peeking! Laters!
Jill: Why did you look specifically at me when saying that?!
Sei: Your boss looked so cute with those ears, right Stella?
Stella: She... looked pretty good with them.
Jill: Do you still think it's just a prank?
Stella: No... I mean, I want to think it's still just a bad joke, but her ears were real. I don't know what to think now...
Jill: Why do you care in the first place?
Stella: Huh?
Jill: What does it concern you that there's milk that makes you grow cat ears?
Stella: Oh. Hmm... I think it's because it makes these ears become an aesthetic choice.
Stella: I never got to decide if I wanted them or not. I was basically born with them.
Stella: In a way, they are like scars. Proof that it was only thanks to complicated medical procedures that I was able to live at all.
Sei: Stella...
Stella: And now you just drink a glass of milk to get them... It feels... wrong.
Stella: Like... I don't know. All I ever wanted was to not be 'the cat boomer' anymore. But, if cat ears are just a thing you can have now, what does that make me?
Stella: I always thought I just wanted to be normal... But now I'm afraid of it.
Jill: You feel like you want them gone, but at the same time you can't live without them... this feels familiar.
Jill: Look, I don't know if this helps, but think about it. For a long time. You will only regret it if you rush into things.
Jill: And about your ears. I'm sure nobody will think less of you if everyone had those ears or if you were to lose yours.
Jill: They are part of you, but that's all they are. A part. And only you can decide how big that part is.
Jill: You shouldn't let anyone or anything make you feel less for who you are. Especially not a stiff glass of milk.
Stella: When you put it like that, it does sound kind of stupid.
Sei: You're always overthinking things, Stella. You're you, that's all that matters to us.
Stella: Thank you, both of you. I feel a bit better already.
Jill: And if it's any consultation, now the world is ready for you to make the choice if you want them or not.
Stella: Huh? ...Yeah...
Stella: Yeah, you're right! I finally have a choice. Thank you, again.
Jill: Don't mention it. Now, can I get you anything else?
Stella: No, thank you. It's about time Sei and I to be on our way anyway.
Sei: Is it already? Where does the time go?
Stella: Come, I'll drive you home. Even though you've proven that you're faster than my car.
Sei: That was full-sprint. And you were delayed by that accident.
Stella: No need to be humble now. Goodbye, Jill.
Sei: But I'm not- eh, goodbye, Jill. Hey, wait up!
Jill: Bye, you two.
Jill: (That milk really did a number on Stella...)


*Main2*
Jill: ..........
Jill: (It's so quiet all of a sudden...)
Jill: (Normally at least Gil would be here, cursing while cleaning glasses or something...)
Jill: (I wouldn't be surprised to see him just waltz through the door right now.)
Gillian: I'm back!
Jill: WAAAAAH!!
Jill: (*sigh* I stand corrected.)
Gillian: Woah, are you okay? You almost dropped that glass. You get scared way too easily, you know?
Jill: I'm fine. I was just- uhh...
Gillian: Hm? Oh, the ears? Chief made me drink some strange milk she got.
Jill: I guessed as much. How do you feel?
Gillian: Not much different, to be honest. Just all that subconscious movement on my head is throwing me off a little.
Jill: You... look surprisingly good with them. Very cute.
Gillian: I'll take the compliment, even if I know you just want to rub it in.
Jill: Maaaybe. By the way, where were you?
Gillian: Boss sent me to send a gift back to her friend in Saint Alicia.
Jill: Iris? Do you know what she sent?
Gillian: She never told me, but when I went to refill the drink dispenser when I came in today, the Karmotrine was awfully low.
Jill: .....
Gillian: And I mean surprisingly low even considering your... generous use of it.
Jill: Are you implying that I use more Karomotrine than necessary? These drinks are expensive and I want people to feel like they got their money's worth, Gillian!
Jill: People come here to forget their troubles after all, and if more Karmotrine helps them, then so be it!
Gillian: Woah, calm down. I'm just joking. No need to break character.
Jill: *ahem* Right. I'm just a bit... on edge.
Gillian: I can see that... Anything happen while I was gone?
Jill: Well, a bit. I just have a hard time dealing with the existence of that milk.
Gillian: Not surprising. I see you got yourself a glass too. You interesed in getting a extra pair of ears then?


*Interested*
Jill: Well, I would lie if I said I didn't at least think about it.
Jill: ...What's with that look?
Gillian: I'm just surprised you actually did. I didn't take you for the kind that cares about aesthetic mods.
Jill: I don't, normally. I never got more than a piercing or two. But the ears just seem... fun.
Jill: And besides, if there's a milk to make them appear, there's a way to get them removed as well. Or the effects might just be temporary in the first place.
Gillian: I sure hope so... So, are you gonna drink it?
Jill: Not yet. It's still a big decision.
Gillian: Fair enough. Well, I'll get to wiping the tables then.


*NotInterested*
Jill: Can't say I am. Boss just put it here to have customers see it.
Gillian: Does it work?
Jill: You'd be surprised. But anyway, I don't think I can justify such a big change for something so... useless.
Jill: They are cute, yes, but not much more. And besides, it feels wrong to get something that's normally a leftover of a medical treatment.
Gillian: You put alot of thought into it, huh? Well, I can't disagree on that account.
Jill: I just got to see it from a cat boomers perspective is all. But even if that weren't the case, I don't really care about aesthetic mods in the first place.
Gillian: Heh, that sounds very much like you. Well, I'll get to wiping the tables then.


*AlreadyDanya*
Danya: Are you back Gillinyan? Did they take the package?
Gillinyan: Yes they did, but only after- ...Wait, did you just call me Gilli-NYAN?
Jill: ...Gillinyan *PFFFT*
Gillinyan: Not you too.
Jill: It's a cute nickname.
Gillinyan: Did Chief tell you that she wants to be called Danya already?
Jill: She mentioned it, yeah. She's really having fun, huh?


*StillDana*
Dana: Are you back Gillinyan? Did they take the package?
Gillinyan: Yes, they did, but only after- ...Wait, did you just call me Gilli-NYAN?
Jill: ...Gillinyan *PFFFT*
Gillinyan: Not you too.
Jill: It's a cute nickname.
Gillinyan: Did Chief tell you that she wants to be called Danya already?
Jill: Huh, really? ...yeah, ok. Seems like a thing she would say. She's really having fun, isn't she?


*Main3*
Gillinyan: I guess. At least you two are enjoying yourself.
Jill: Hey, don't lie. I can see that slight smirk. You're an open book Gil.
Danya: Hey, Gillinyan. Get to work! No time for cat naps!
Gillinyan: Hm. Maybe the absurdity of the situation is getting to me after all.
Jill: That's the spirit.
Gillinyan: ...well, those tables ain't gonna wipe themselves.
Jill: Nope, not since they tried to eat all the napkins a while back.
Gillinyan: ...Right. That too. Anyway, you know where to find me. 
Jill: Sure thing, Gillinyan.
Gillinyan: I'm not- urgh, forget it.
Jill: (I should really take some photos of them, just in case the milk really is only temporary)
Jill: (Now where did I leave my phone?)
Jill: (I need to think of some plan to get Gil to let me take a photo...)
